        <h5>Croissant Fun Facts</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Croissants were originally inspired by a Viennese pastry called the
            kipferl.
          </li>
          <li>
            The word "croissant" means "crescent" in French, which perfectly
            describes their shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            To enjoy croissants at their best, warm them up in the oven for a
            few minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the classic plain croissant is a favorite, there are numerous
            variations, including almond croissants, chocolate croissants (pain
            au chocolat), and ham and cheese croissants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Croissants and coffee make a classic and delicious combination. They
            are often enjoyed together, with the croissant's buttery goodness
            complementing the coffee's rich flavors.
